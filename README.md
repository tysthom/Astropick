# Astropick
"Astropick" is a 3rd person survival game taking place on the moon. Survive against waves of spawning aliens for as long as possible. Collect floating astral-material on the moons surface to increase your score and 
gain powerups. Will you conquer the lunar horizon, or become just another casualty in the void of space? The choice is yours in "Astropick"!

"Astropick" was created as a part of the IEEE SouteastCon 2025 Software Competition. Five Bethune-Cookman University students worked together over the span of 48 hours to create a playable video game based off the word "pick."
